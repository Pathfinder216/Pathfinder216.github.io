                This is a collection of my shareable coding projects over the years.
                Much of my experience is in proprietary software I can't share, but
                these projects can give you some idea of what I've done and what my work
                is like.

                    This is a website I made for my high school robotics team. I
                    originally wrote it in HTML/CSS, but I recently rewrote it in
                    Vite React with Typescript to get more React/Typescript
                    experience and show my experience with it.
